I have taken the old version on the Master branch and added a few updgrades!  It is now a reusable game where the trivia can be switched out with a new Trivia object.  Layout is now created using jQuery instead of staticly lurking in HTML.

See the ***Update branch*** for this new version which is available to play on https://dmwiggins.github.io/TriviaGame/

*Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery*
