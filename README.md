I have taken the old version and added a few upgrades!  It is now a reusable game where the trivia can be switched out with a new Trivia object.  Layout is created using jQuery instead of staticly lurking in HTML.  [snippet of old html](assets/images/oldhtml.png)

This new version is available to play on https://dmwiggins.github.io/TriviaGame/

*Created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery*
